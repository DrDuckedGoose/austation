The xenoarchaeology system is a subdepartment within science. The sub-department features a unique gameplay loop that allows scientists
to discover unique artefacts and unlock tech.

===Artifact system===
Artefacts are generated with three unique aspects, an activation, ability, and strength. Activation refers to how the artifact is used,
this can be through impact, vocal, or charge. Ability refers to what the artifact will do upon activation, listed below, every artifact
has three, two minor and one major. Strength refers to how powerfull the artifact is, and how much activation is required, the maximum
is 100. 

Activations:



Abilities:
===Minor===
Hollow, acts as a multiplier. The strength is changed by (((100 - strength)) * 0.5)+strength), this does not affect activation strength.

Capacitive, acts as an internal battery. Every time the artifact is activated unsuccessfully, it saves the charge until it fills enough
to activate. This can be used to get large strength values greater than 100, this is intentional.

Shaped, makes the artifact sharp. Shaped glass.

Dense, increases the artifacts force value.


 
===Major===
Capturing, the activating entity is captured for a duration equal to (Strength * 0.6) seconds

Temporal, stops time in that area, similar to sepia slime extracts, for a duration equal to (Strength * 0.1) seconds
